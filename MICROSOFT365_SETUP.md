# ✅ MICROSOFT 365 EMAIL SETUP (GoDaddy)

## 🎯 **Perfect! You're using Microsoft 365 from GoDaddy**

I've updated the configuration for Microsoft 365. Here's what you need to do:

## ✅ **Current Configuration**

Your render.yaml is now configured for Microsoft 365:
```yaml
EMAIL_HOST = smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = info@lbdhospitals.com
EMAIL_PASS = Alivexbs12355@
```

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

1. **Changed SMTP host** from `smtp.gmail.com` to `smtp-mail.outlook.com`
2. **Added Microsoft 365 specific configuration** in the email service
3. **Fixed the render.yaml** structure (was malformed)

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### 1. Update Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render dashboard and update these environment variables:

```
EMAIL_HOST = smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = info@lbdhospitals.com
EMAIL_PASS = Alivexbs12355@
```

### 2. Verify Microsoft 365 Settings
Make sure your Microsoft 365 account has:
- ✅ **SMTP AUTH enabled** (usually enabled by default)
- ✅ **Less secure app access** enabled (if required)
- ✅ **Correct password** (your Microsoft 365 password)

## 📧 **Expected Results**

After Render redeploys, you should see:
```
🔧 Using Microsoft 365/Office 365 SMTP configuration
📧 smtp-mail.outlook.com transporter created, verifying connection...
✅ Email service configured successfully with smtp-mail.outlook.com
```

And when sending emails:
```
📧 Attempting to send email to: user@example.com
📧 Subject: Stock Alert - CRITICAL Level: ItemName
📧 Email service configured: true
📧 Transporter exists: true
✅ Email sent successfully!
   Message ID: <message-id>
   Response: 250 OK
```

## 🔍 **Microsoft 365 SMTP Details**

- **Host**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com`
- **Port**: `587` (STARTTLS)
- **Security**: STARTTLS (not SSL)
- **Authentication**: Username/Password

## 🆘 **If Still Having Issues**

1. **Check your Microsoft 365 password** - make sure it's correct
2. **Enable SMTP AUTH** in Microsoft 365 admin center
3. **Check if 2FA is enabled** - you might need an app password
4. **Verify the email address** - make sure `info@lbdhospitals.com` is correct

## 🎉 **This Should Work Now!**

Microsoft 365 SMTP is much more reliable than Gmail from cloud providers. Your email notifications should work perfectly now!

**WhatsApp is already working, and now emails should work too!** 🚀
